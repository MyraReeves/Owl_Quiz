I added <br> breaks in between my paragraphs as a quick and easy/dirty fix to add padding between my paragraphs of text.  I realize that I will need to add CSS to fix the problem longer term. -->

        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <!-- <br> -->
        <p> I have lived in several locales in my life, including having been a Zonian when I was a young child. I currently live in the southeastern farmland of the Puget Sound Area of Washington state (Pierce County).  My college degree basically prepared graduates to work outdoors in the field doing things like radio-tracking wild animals or monitoring the impacts of logging on Forest Service land.</p>

                Since most raptor centers hold permits to use permanently disabled birds for educational purposes, that student experience quickly led after graduation to paying jobs educating the public about raptors, and then extrapolated over to educating about various other wild animals who had been trained to be handled. So I pivoted very quickly after college graduation into husbandry care of animals in the education departments at zoological facilities. In the final years of that career, a priceless opportunity to learn animal training techniques with marine mammals led me down an even more specialized path, which was training education animals for educational zoo stage shows. During my career with wildlife, I cared for and trained a huge variety of different species (everything from insects to domesticated animals) but the ones I gained the most experience with were marine mammals and birds of prey. -->

            Five and a half years ago, life forced me to find a temporary job of driving city buses, which became something more permanent.  I worked evenings, but it was nice for the first time in my life to finally have a Monday to Friday job with major holidays off.  During the height of the pandemic, there was no change at all in my daily work routine except for none of the middle class commuters riding the bus anymore, more violence at work, and a dramatically sharp increase in passengers abusing opiods. -->
